I've led dozens of field trips across Southern California, in habitats ranging from the wetlands, scrublands and woodlands of Orange County and the Los Angeles Basin, to the mixed conifer forests in the San Gabriel Mountains, to the Salton Sea deep in the Colorado Desert. Whether you're a local birder to Southern California or visiting from elsewhere, I can help you find the special bird you are looking, whether it be California Gnatcatcher, White-headed Woodpecker, Abert's Towhee, or something else entirely. Reach out for information on rates.
